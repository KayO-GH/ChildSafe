# ChildSafe
The ChildSafe Android application works with the ChildSafe chrome extension to monitor sites visited by children and report inappropriate access to parents/guardians. Both images were built during the Hack APIs hackathon from 30th November to 1st December 2018. Cloudinary's image recognition and storage API's were used to build the project.
